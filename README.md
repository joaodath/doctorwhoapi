A simple NodeJS + Express.js RESTful API serving data about Doctor Who.

## Intro

Have you ever felt the urging need to fetch data about Doctor Who? Have you 
ever got up startled in the middle of the night after having a bad dream 
about not knowing EVERYTHING there is to know about Doctor Who using a simple 
yet very effective RESTful API for that?

Well, your problems are over, friend! :) 
Presenting the Doctor Who API (unofficial). A simple, fast and easy to 
understand-maintain-deploy-consume API containing just about everything 
there is to know.

## Why?
The Doctor Who API (unofficial) exists to serve the single purpose of fixing 
the urges to fetch data about Doctor Who. 

## How to get started
Soon I'll share the secret.

## Acknowledgments
I'd like to first give a shout out to the incredible minds at work on 
Doctor Who. You're the reason I kept dreaming and looking up to the stars 
after all those years.

Then, I'd like to give a round of applauses to my wonderful teacher whom 
inspires me to be a little bit better everyday and change the world 
(however I can): **[Thiago Lima](https://github.com/codethi)**. 
As he would say: SWIPE UP!
